    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. About MealMiles</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      MealMiles Enterprises Limited (“MealMiles”) operates a software marketplace that enables diners (“Customers”)
      to place orders with independent restaurants (“Restaurants”). MealMiles is not a restaurant.
      Our principal place of business is Surrey, British Columbia, Canada.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Merchant of Record</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Each Restaurant is the seller and merchant of record for its orders. Restaurants set prices, prepare food,
      fulfill orders, and are responsible for applicable sales taxes, refunds, and compliance with food safety laws.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Charges & Payment</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Customers are charged at checkout in the displayed currency. Payments are processed by Stripe.
      Your statement may display the restaurant name. You authorize the charge for the total shown at checkout,
      including taxes and any service fees.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Customers may cancel an order within <strong>5 minutes</strong> of placement or before the Restaurant starts
      preparation, whichever occurs first. After that point, refunds are at the Restaurant’s discretion. If a
      Restaurant cancels an order (including out-of-stock or closure), a full refund will be issued. Refunds are
      returned to the original payment method; processing times depend on your bank or card issuer.
    </p>


    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Loyalty Points</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Customers may earn MealMiles points at participating Restaurants. Points have no cash value, are not legal
      tender, are non-transferable, and may expire if your account is inactive for 12 months. Refunds or order
      cancellations may reduce points earned. Program rules may change with notice in the app or on this site.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Platform Fees</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      MealMiles may charge a platform/service fee to Customers and/or Restaurants. Any fee will be shown prior to
      checkout or disclosed during Restaurant onboarding.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You agree not to misuse the app, interfere with security, or engage in fraudulent chargebacks or abuse of
      promotions. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Disclaimers & Liability</h2>
    <p class="mb-8">
      THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. MEALMILES DOES NOT PREPARE FOOD AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT A RESTAURANT’S
      FOOD QUALITY, ALLERGENS, OR FULFILLMENT. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MEALMILES IS NOT LIABLE FOR
      INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
