Place the screenshot assets for the wiki in this folder.

Expected filenames referenced by the page (currently SVG placeholders):
- 01-enter-edit-mode-top-right.svg  – top-right edit/confirm button visible
- 02-section-trash-icons.svg        – edit mode with section trash icons
- 03-item-more-menu-delete.svg      – item action sheet with Delete

You can replace these with real screenshots by dropping PNGs (or JPEGs) with the
same filenames into this folder. If you prefer PNGs/JPEGs, just keep the names
the same but change the extension in the wiki page, or overwrite the SVGs.
Recommended width: 800–1200px.
